        <h2>1. Executive summary</h2>
        <p>
          DFi Labs seeks <strong>USD 20 million</strong> of seed capital to
          accelerate deployment of its <em>Descartes</em> strategy through a
          Cayman segregated portfolio on the Atitlan SPC platform. Descartes is
          a fully algorithmic, cross‑sectional momentum strategy: each day it
          takes long positions in the strongest‑performing liquid crypto‑assets
          and short positions in the weakest. By matching long and short
          exposures it delivers <strong>delta‑neutral</strong> returns uncorrelated
          with broad market movements. The strategy targets around
          <strong>USD 150 million</strong> of deployable capacity and offers
          investors pure alpha. Atitlan SPC is registered with the Cayman
          Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA), providing robust governance and
          regulatory oversight.

      <!-- Market opportunity & rationale -->
      <section id="market-opportunity" class="content-section alt-bg">
        <h2>2. Market opportunity &amp; rationale</h2>
        <p>
          The digital‑asset market remains highly volatile and weakly correlated
          with other asset classes. This volatility, combined with the wide
          dispersion in returns across tokens, creates persistent relative‑value
          opportunities. Institutional infrastructure – prime brokerage,
          institutional custody, transparent price discovery and clearing – has
          matured considerably, enabling professional investors to access crypto
          markets with traditional risk controls. Cross‑sectional momentum
          strategies have delivered compelling risk‑adjusted returns across
          equities and now, increasingly, in digital assets. By comparing the
          relative strength of liquid tokens and arbitraging the spread between
          outperformers and underperformers, investors can capture
          inefficiencies while maintaining market neutrality.

        <h2>3. Strategy description</h2>
        <p>
          <em>Descartes</em> is a systematic, market‑neutral strategy that
          harvests cross‑sectional momentum in liquid crypto‑assets. It is
          designed and implemented by DFi Labs’ quantitative research team and
          runs under a rigorous risk and governance framework.

          The fund operates under the Atitlan SPC platform, a Cayman‑domiciled
          segregated portfolio company. Each SP within the SPC is ring‑fenced:
          liabilities are limited to the assets of that SP and other portfolios
          remain unaffected. The SPC is administered by Bolder Corporate
          Services and advised by BGA Law. It is registered with the Cayman
          Islands Monetary Authority and complies with the Mutual Funds Act,
          Anti‑Money Laundering Regulations and the CIMA Statement of

          Independent directors (for example, from Paradigm Governance
          Partners) ensure that fund operations and risk management meet
          best‑practice standards. The fund will appoint a Money‑Laundering
          Reporting Officer and AML Compliance Officer, maintain up‑to‑date

          of interest, and submit annual audited accounts.
